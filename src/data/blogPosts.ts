      <p>One of the most common dilemmas in real estate is whether to rent or buy a property. This decision significantly impacts your financial future and lifestyle. Let's analyze both options to help you make an informed choice based on current market conditions.</p>

      <h2>The Case for Buying</h2>
      <p>Homeownership offers several advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Equity Building:</strong> Monthly payments build ownership stake</li>
        <li><strong>Stability:</strong> No rent increases or forced relocations</li>
        <li><strong>Tax Benefits:</strong> Deductions on home loan interest and principal</li>
        <li><strong>Appreciation:</strong> Potential for long-term property value growth</li>
        <li><strong>Freedom:</strong> Ability to modify and personalize your space</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Case for Renting</h2>
      <p>Renting also has compelling benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Easy to relocate for career or lifestyle changes</li>
        <li><strong>Lower Upfront Costs:</strong> No down payment or closing costs</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance-Free:</strong> Landlord handles repairs and upkeep</li>
        <li><strong>Investment Opportunity:</strong> Capital can be invested elsewhere</li>
        <li><strong>Access to Premium Locations:</strong> Rent in areas you couldn't afford to buy</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Financial Analysis</h2>
      <p>Let's compare the numbers for a typical Delhi property:</p>

      <h3>Buying Scenario (₹50 Lakh Property)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Down Payment: ₹10 Lakh</li>
        <li>Home Loan: ₹40 Lakh at 8.5% for 20 years</li>
        <li>Monthly EMI: ₹34,500</li>
        <li>Additional Costs: ₹2.5 Lakh (registration, legal, etc.)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Renting Scenario</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Monthly Rent: ₹25,000</li>
        <li>Security Deposit: ₹2 Lakh</li>
        <li>Investment of ₹12.5 Lakh at 12% returns: ₹1,500/month</li>
        <li>Net Monthly Cost: ₹23,500</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Decision Factors</h2>
      <p>Consider these factors when making your choice:</p>

      <h3>Choose Buying If:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You plan to stay in the same location for 5+ years</li>
        <li>You have stable income and emergency funds</li>
        <li>Property prices are reasonable relative to rents</li>
        <li>You value stability and building equity</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Choose Renting If:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your career requires frequent relocations</li>
        <li>You're early in your career with income uncertainty</li>
        <li>Property prices are very high relative to rents</li>
        <li>You prefer investing in other assets</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Current Market Conditions</h2>
      <p>In today's Delhi market:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Property prices have stabilized after recent growth</li>
        <li>Interest rates are at moderate levels</li>
        <li>Rental yields are 3-5% in most areas</li>

      </ul>
